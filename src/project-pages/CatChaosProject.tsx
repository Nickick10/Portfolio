                        Cat Chaos is a third & first person cat simulator where players take 
                        on the role of one of the many mischievous cats with one goal‚Äîcause 
                        as much destruction as possible before sunrise, all while avoiding 
                        detection by their sleeping owner. The game is designed for PC, 
                        targeting casual gamers and cat lovers who enjoy physics-based 
                        sandbox experiences and lighthearted chaos.

                                balance destruction with stealth to avoid alerting the owner before sunrise.

                                chasing the player. A roaming dog character adds pressure by barking 
                                when nearby, increasing noise and the risk of alerting the owner.
