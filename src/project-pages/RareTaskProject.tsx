                    <p>
                        Rare Task Reminder is designed for busy homeowners juggling 
                        full-time jobs and everyday responsibilities. It solves a 
                        common and frustrating problem: remembering infrequent but 
                        important maintenance tasks that keep your home and life running 
                        smoothly. Tasks like changing air filters, checking smoke detectors, 
                        flipping mattresses, or changing your car‚Äôs oil often fall through the 
                        cracks‚Äînot because they‚Äôre hard, but because they happen so rarely.
