        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about creating technology that makes a difference. 
          From an early interest in software to earning my degree in Computer Science with a concentration 
          in Software Engineering, I've grown through hands-on experience and countless hours of building, 
          learning, and problem-solving. Along the way, I've developed meaningful projects that
          reflect my dedication to innovation and continuous growth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm always excited to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what I can do. 
          Whether it's refining a product, collaborating on a team, or learning a new framework, 
          I love the process of bringing ideas to life through code.
        </p>
